# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
In this project, we are helping a company named Pewlett Hackard, how to set data that offer retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and which position need to be fulled in in the future. We will be working with a few CSV files, visualize and analyze the data in the table. This project will also allow us to determine the relationship between the different tables by using PgAdmin and Postgre SQL.




his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
